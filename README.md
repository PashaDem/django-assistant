# django-assistant
Hey, this is my first Django-project =) It would store here for me to watch back and see my first Django experience.
The idea of this project was to create a Django-assistant, with whom you can easily have a dialog) 
I was working in a group of three and was responsible for the Django-application,
while my colleagues were responsible for the AI-model and design (I was also participating in designing)
We realized it as we could=) 
#Now I realize that there are to many mistakes, some of them are:
1) Some unimportant files were uploaded to git (.gitattributes, pycache, db.sqlite3)
2) Some extra image files, which were not used were uploaded too
3) Ajax script was not in the js-directory, but inside the html file
4) Business logic was not separated from the view's code
5) Not-optimised ORM requests
6) In some places the code is extra-commented
 - They are only some of mistakes, I sure you can find more=(
 #But there are some moments I want to add to my project in the future besides improving my mistakes, they are:
 1) Adding another database (PostgreSql)
 2) Switching a project to DRF
 3) Dockerization of an application
 4) Configuring remote access to the AI-model (because it weights too much and I can't deploy it on free hosts like Heroku or PythonAnywhere)
 Wish me good luck)
